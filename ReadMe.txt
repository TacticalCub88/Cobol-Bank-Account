1. This project is a COBOL program that allows users to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw money, and view their balance. 
It is a simple but useful program that can be used by individuals or small businesses to manage their finances.

2. This project is useful because it provides a practical example of how COBOL can be used to create real-world applications. 
It demonstrates how COBOL can be used to handle data input and output, perform calculations, and interact with files.
Additionally, since COBOL is still widely used in the banking and finance industries, 
this project provides valuable experience for anyone interested in pursuing a career in those fields.
